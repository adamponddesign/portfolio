              <p>March - June 2019</p>
              <p>The three month full-time course at General Assembly was a great opportunity to build rich, interactive, full-stack apps with key languages and dive into algorithms, data structures, design patterns, APIs, and more.
I gained a lot of self-confidence, proving to myself that working alone or in a group, I have the skills and attitude to achieve challenging tasks within a set time period.</p>
